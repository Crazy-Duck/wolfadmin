WolfAdmin module for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory servers.
Copyright (C) 2015 Timo 'Timothy' Smit

REQUIREMENTS

  * Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory server
  * NoQuarter mod (1.2.7 or higher, maybe 1.2.5 works as well)
  * Lua 5.1 library and Lua modules enabled (installed binaries)
  * A MySQL server is required if you want to use alias listing, warn and 
    level history. Otherwise the module will not work, so please make sure
    you have one. If you want to make use of a MySQL server, the module 
    requires an additional MySQL library (luasql.mysql).
    In case you do not have the LuaSQL MySQL library installed, you are 
    able to download this library from the WolfAdmin file database at 
    http://dev.timosmit.com/files/wolfadmin/.

INSTRUCTIONS (NEW)

  * Unpack the /luascripts folder into your /nq directory
  * Unpack the contents of the /config folder into your /nq directory (or 
    /.etwolf/nq on Linux systems)
  * Optionally, copy the contents of the cvars.cfg to your own server 
    configuration file
  * Copy the .pk3 file corresponding to this WolfAdmin version to your 
    /nq directory
  * Modify /nq/wolfadmin.cfg to your needs
  * Modify /nq/shrubbot.cfg to add WolfAdmin specific flags
  * Add /luascripts/wolfadmin/main.lua to the lua_modules cvar
  * Run the .sql script in /database/new on your MySQL server
  * Run your server

INSTRUCTIONS (UPGRADE)

  * Unpack the /luascripts folder into your /nq directory
  * Run the .sql script in /database/upgrade/previous-version-here on your 
    MySQL server
  * Run your server

TROUBLESHOOTING

  * libmysqlclient.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or 
    directory
      This means you need an additional library for the LuaSQL module, which is 
      used by WolfAdmin for the database connection. This file can usually be 
      downloaded via your package manager or from the WolfAdmin file database 
      at http://dev.timosmit.com/files/wolfadmin/. After downloading you will 
      have to copy this file to your fs_basepath (usually the root folder of 
      the server, where the etded file is located).
  * WolfAdmin config will not get loaded/one of greetings/rules is not loaded
      Make sure that there are two empty lines (containing no spaces) at the 
      end of your .cfg files. Due to the loading mechanism WolfAdmin uses, you 
      have to add these completely empty lines, right at the end. Additionally,
      between two blocks of information you also have to leave an empty line.
      Check the config files in the /config folder for an example.
